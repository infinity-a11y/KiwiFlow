# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please help us fix it by reporting it responsibly through the proper channels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security reports.** Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before a fix is ready puts all users at risk.

### How to Report
We prefer that you use **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature. This allows for secure, private communication and collaborative fixing.

* **Submit a report here:** [https://github.com/infinity-a11y/KiwiMS/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/infinity-a11y/KiwiMS/security/advisories/new)
* **Alternative Email:** If you cannot use the link above, please contact us at **marian.freisleben@liora-bioinformatics.com**

### What to Include
To help us triage and fix the issue quickly, please include:
* **Description:** A brief summary of the vulnerability.
* **Severity:** Your assessment of the impact (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
* **Steps to Reproduce:** A detailed guide, Proof of Concept (PoC) script, or screenshots.
* **Impact:** What an attacker could achieve if this is exploited.

* **Respect Privacy:** Do not attempt to access, modify, or delete data belonging to other users.
* **No Destructive Testing:** Avoid any testing that could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) or data corruption.
* **Stay in Scope:** Only report vulnerabilities related to the source code within this repository.
